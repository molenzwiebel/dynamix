\chapter{Design choices}

\todo[inline]{We need a place somewhere to go from floaty hypothetical land to concrete facts land. Right now, we've discussed several approaches for how one might design a DSL, and we've introduced Spoofax. However, we've not yet said how any of this directly relates to Dynamix. If we want the next chapters to be Tim and Dynamix, we'll likely need to make it slightly more concrete before we jump into it. Maybe illustrate the Dynamix architecture/pipeline first? Although this does make it weird as we'll effetively split up the Dynamix chapter into two separate chapters.}

\todo[inline]{This is also probably a good place to talk about the fact that Dynamix was (partially)inherited from earlier work by Eelco, Andrew.}
